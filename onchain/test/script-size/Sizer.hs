-- Attempt to estimate the script size.  Note that:
--
--  * `programSize` counts the number of AST nodes in a program, which is very
--     much different from the actual size of serialized script added to the
--     transaction.
--
--  * We optimize the script before estiamting its size, because this gets us
--    closer to how the scripts are being serialized for the off-chain code.
--
--  * Plutus abandoned CBOR serialization in favour of flat serialization. See
--    https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/doc/notes/plutus-core/Serialisation-flat.md
--    for details.
--
--  * In order for any size approximation to make sense it has to be monotone.
--    In other words, if we attempt to approximate the size of compiled scripts
--    by AST size it must be the case that:
--
--       size(AST_1) < size(AST_2)  ==>  size(flat(AST_1)) <= size(flat(AST_2))
--
--    where "AST" is a UPLC program's AST, "size" computes the size, and "flat"
--    performs flat encoding, or any other encoding used by cardano-node to
--    represent transactions.  Note that we don't require strict monotonicity.
--    If monotonicity doesn't hold then our size estimations will be useless,
--    because then it can happen that making the AST size smaller will make the
--    flat encoding larger.
