How to use:

* first run:
  $ ./init.sh <KEYPATH.skey> [vkey=KEYPATH.vkey [SPO_SKEY] [SIDECHAIN_SKEY]]

* subsequent runs:
  $ ./someScript.sh        # just build
  $ ./someScript.sh submit # build & submit

* some scripts rely on each other, for example, a burn relies on a prior mint.
  there is no attempt to specify these relations in the shell scripts, rather,
  it's the responsibility of the runner making sure submitted transactions are
  confirmed, and subsequent transactions can be run.
