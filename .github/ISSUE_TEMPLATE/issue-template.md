<!--
After posting a new issue here on GitHub, make sure that there is a corresponding ticket on Jira:

1. Go to Jira: https://input-output.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ETCM/boards/1204
2. Create a new ticket there. Copy the issue title from GitHub. Put just the link to GitHub issue in the description.
3. In order for the ticket to show on the board you need to add a label. In the client squad we use `Sidechains_Client_Squad`. This might later change once you start working in a different squad, but for now use that label
4. Set the Epic to ETCM-5178 (Improve the trustless sidechain)
5. If you intend to start working on the new issue right away make sure to add the ticket to the current sprint and assign yourself.
6. Go back to GitHub and edit the description to point back to Jira Ticket - see below.
7. Try to add labels to categorize the issue here on GitHub. If unsure, ask or leave empty.
